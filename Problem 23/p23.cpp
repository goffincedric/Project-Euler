/*
 * Problem 23:
 *
 * A perfect number is a number for which the sum of its proper divisors is exactly
 * equal to the number. For example, the sum of the proper divisors of 28 would be
 * 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28, which means that 28 is a perfect number.
 *
 * A number n is called deficient if the sum of its proper divisors is less than n
 * and it is called abundant if this sum exceeds n.
 *
 * As 12 is the smallest abundant number, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16, the smallest number
 * that can be written as the sum of two abundant numbers is 24. By mathematical analysis,
 * it can be shown that all integers greater than 28123 can be written as the sum of
 * two abundant numbers. However, this upper limit cannot be reduced any further by
 * analysis even though it is known that the greatest number that cannot be expressed
 * as the sum of two abundant numbers is less than this limit.
 *
 * Find the sum of all the positive integers which cannot be written as the sum of two abundant numbers.
